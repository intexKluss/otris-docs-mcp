# Class HitResultset<K, HL>

The HitResultset class allows comprehensive search operations in Documents and in connected archives.

While the constructor of this class launches a search operation, the created object stores the results
and exposes them as a list of DocHit objects. Compared with the classes `FileResultset` and `ArchiveFileResultset`
this class has got the following characteristics.

- Several filetypes and archives can be searched at one time.
- Extracting archive hits from a HitResultset does not make DOCUMENTS create a temporary DocFile for each hit. This can save a lot of time.
- Objects of this class may allocate large amounts of memory, because they sustain a complete hit list instead of a lean id-list. To save memory, scripts should prefer hit lists with as few columns as possible.
- Search-related errors and warnings do not trigger exceptions. Instead, they are stored inside the object. You can access them with getLastErrorCode() and getLastError() respectively. Advantage: The caller gets the freedom to process the results also after a warning. In this case the hit list maybe incomplete or unsorted.

## Properties


### Readonlysearchability

`searchability: number`

Searchability indicator for folder-based or register-based HitResultsets.

For objects created by Folder.getHitResultset() or Register.getHitResultset() without a fulltextFilter parameter this property provides a hint, if the same operation can succeed with a non-empty fulltext filter. For other HitResultsets it is not meaningful. Possible values:

0 = The folder/register is not capable of fulltext searching.
1 = The folder/register technically supports fulltext searching. User interfaces, however, should hide or disable corresponding input fields due to the actual DOCUMENTS-settings.
3 = The folder/register is ready for fulltext searching.

Note: The value can be interpreted as a bitmask, where Bit 0 indicates technical searchability and Bit 1 indicates UI-driven searchability.

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 5.0f

**See:** Folder.getHitResultset


## Methods


### [iterator]

`"[iterator]"(): IterableIterator<DocHitWithFields<NormalizeToKeys<K>, HL>>`

**Returns:** IterableIterator<DocHitWithFields<NormalizeToKeys<K>, HL>>


### dispose

`dispose(): any`

Free most of the memory of the HitResultset.

This function explicitly frees the memory used by the object. The Resultset itself becomes empty. All extracted DocHit objects become invalid and must no longer be used. Long-running scripts should use this function instead of waiting for the garbage collector to clean up.

**Returns:** any

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b


### fetchedSize

`fetchedSize(): number`

Get the number of already loaded hits in the set.

Note: If the object has been created with a non-zero page size, this value is often smaller than the total amount of hits.

**Returns:** number

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b

**See:** size


### fetchNextPage

`fetchNextPage(): boolean`

Load the next page of hits into the Resultset.

If the object has been created with a non-zero page size, each call of this function appends another page of hits to the resultset until all hits are loaded.

**Returns:** boolean

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b


### first

`first(): DocHitWithFields<NormalizeToKeys<K>, HL>`

Retrieve the first DocHit in the HitResultset.

**Returns:** DocHitWithFields<NormalizeToKeys<K>, HL>

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b

**See:** next


### getAt

`getAt(pos: number): DocHit`

Retrieve the DocHit object at a given position in the HitResultset.

Note: Valid positions range from 0 to fetchedSize()-1.

**Parameters:**

- `pos`: `number` — Integer position of the hit, beginning with 0

**Returns:** DocHit

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b


### getColumnCount

`getColumnCount(): number`

Get the number of available columns in the set of hits.

**Returns:** number

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b


### getColumnIndex

`getColumnIndex(colName: string): number`

Find the index of a column with a defined name.

Note: The function tests for a technical column name prior to a localized name.

**Parameters:**

- `colName`: `string` — The name of the column.

**Returns:** number

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b


### getColumnNames

`getColumnNames(local?: boolean): any[]`

List the names of all columns in the set of hits.

Note: If the resultset is bases on an EE.i hitlist, the function usually returns field numbers instead of technical names, because column descriptions of an EE.i hitlist only consist of the field number and a label. The label would not be a reliable identifier of the column. Columns, which correspond to a DocFile attribute may be given a special constant name instead of the name in an archive's scheme. "TITLE" on EE.x and "110" on EE.i may be presented as "DlcFile_Title", for example.

**Parameters:**

- `local`: `boolean` — A boolean option to read the localized names instead of the technical names.

Default: false

**Returns:** any[]

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b


### getHitIds

`getHitIds(withServer?: boolean): string[]`

Returns an array with all Hit-Ids (file ids or archive file keys) of the HitResultset.

**Parameters:**

- `withServer`: `boolean` — optional boolean value to indicate, if the archive file keys should include an "@archiveServerName" appendix.

Default: true

**Returns:** string[]

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 5.0d

**See:** FileResultset.getIds


```ts
var searchResources = ["Filetype1@myeas", "Filetype1"];
var myHRS = new HitResultset(searchResources, "", "");
util.out(myHRS.getHitIds());
```


### getLastError

`getLastError(): string`

Function to get the description of the last error (or warning) that occurred.

**Returns:** string

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b

**See:** getLastErrorCode


### getLastErrorCode

`getLastErrorCode(): number`

Function to get a numeric code of the last error, that occurred.

Note: The value 0 means "no error". Positive values indicate warnings or minor errors, while negative values indicate serious errors. After a serious error no hits should be processed. After a minor error, the resultset may be unsorted or truncated, but the contained data is still valid.

**Returns:** number

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b

**See:** getLastError


### next

`next(): DocHitWithFields<NormalizeToKeys<K>, HL>`

Retrieve the next DocHit in the HitResultset.

Note: Calls of getAt() do not affect the internal cursor of next().

**Returns:** DocHitWithFields<NormalizeToKeys<K>, HL>

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b

**See:** first


### putAside

`putAside(lifetime: number, id: string): string`

Put a HitResultset aside, for reuse in a later script execution.

This member function moves the HitResultset into a side buffer, which is located outside the scripting environment. A successful call invalidates the object and its descendant DocHit objects. Later access to these objects by the caller would trigger an exception. The buffered version of the HitResultset, however, can outlive the actual script runtime. It can be reintegrated into script memory by a call of HitResultset.reintegrate(String id).

Note: By default the function assigns a unique id to the buffered object and returns it. The caller may pass a preferred id, which the function will replace or modify only, if it collides with an existing object in the buffer. The caller may instead pass a mandatory id, which is distinguished from preferred ids by an exclamation mark ('!') as the first character. If such an id is already assigned, the function will fail, returning an empty string. Invalid values in the lifetime parameter cause an exception. Please read also the tutorial Moving HitResultsets across script boundaries

**Parameters:**

- `lifetime`: `number` — Lifetime of the buffer object in seconds. Only Integer values in the rande 1 to 7200 are valid.
- `id`: `string` — Optional string with a preferred id or a mandatory id. See remarks.

**Returns:** string

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 6.0


### Staticreintegrate

`reintegrate(id: string): HitResultset`

Reintegrate a HitResultset from the side buffer.

This function does the opposite of HitResultset.putAside(number lifetime, string id). It removes and extracts a HitResultset from the side buffer and reintegrates it into the actual scripting environment. The function can only reintegrate objects of the actual DOCUMENTS principal. The actual user account must also match, except if the script runs in supermode.

Note: Please read also the tutorial Moving HitResultsets across script boundaries!

**Parameters:**

- `id`: `string` — The string which was formerly returned by the putAside() member function.

**Returns:** HitResultset

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 6.0


### size

`size(): number`

Get the total amount of hits in the set.

Note: If the object has been created with a non-zero page size, this value is often greater than the amount of already accessible hits.

**Returns:** number

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b

**See:** fetchedSize


## Constructors


### constructor

`new HitResultset< K extends string | readonly string[] = string, HL extends string | readonly FieldUnion<K>[] = FieldUnion<K>[], >( searchResources: K, filter: string, sortOrder: string, hitlist: HL, pageSize?: number, unlimitedHits?: boolean, fullColumnLength?: boolean, withBlobInfo?: boolean, ): HitResultset<K, HL>`

Perform a search and create a new HitResultset object.

Note: On a failed search request the constructor does not throw errors. To detect this kind of errors scripts should test the object's error state with getLastErrorCode() or getLastError().

Resource identifiers

A "resource identifier" can be one of the following: [ examples in brackets ]

a filetype name [ ftOrder ]
a filetype name for use with an EDA store [ ftOrder@peachitStore1 ]
a filetype name for use with all EDA stores [ ftOrder@ALLEAS ]
a EE.x view key [ Unit=Default/Instance=Default/View=Orders@MyEEX ]
a EE.i archive key [ $(#STANDARD)\ORDERS@STDARC_360 ] Archive resource identifiers should always get a "@Servername" appendix, though Documents recognizes EE.x and EE.i resources of the primary archive server without that appendix.

Resource ordering and hitlist specification

The resource, which owns a specified hitlist, has to be passed in the first position of the list. Search requests in EE.i/EE.x-archives do not work with a filetype's hitlist. These archives require a hitlist of their own. For this reason, a list of resources of different types must be ordered in the following way: EE.x before EE.i before anything else. Requests, which involve more than one Easy Enterprise server can work only, if a hitlist of the given name exists in each resource of these servers.

Automatic hitlist selection

If the parameter "hitlist" is an empty string, Documents scans the search resources for a named hitlist. If no named hitlist exists, Documents initializes an old-fashioned anonymous hitlist, which is based on the "Display in hit list" option of fields in the Documents Manager and on corresponding options for particular DocFile attributes (title, created, owner, last modified, last editor). An anonymous hitlist does actually not work with EE.x. It partially works with EE.i. In this case, Documents externally uses the setting "CommonDefaultHitlist" of the configuration file "ArchiveXML.ini" and transfers matching columns into the internal hitlist. As long as named hitlists become imported with the archive structure, it does not matter.

Search requests, which involve more than one Easy Enterprise server cannot rely on the automatic selection feature. Scripts should always pass an appropriate hitlist name for these requests.

Since: DOCUMENTS 4.0b Since: DOCUMENTS 4.0d HF1 new parameter fullColumnLength Since: DOCUMENTS 5.0 (New option for hitlist parameter: an array of field names instead of a hitlist name)

**Parameters:**

- `searchResources`: `K` — The list of resources to search through. The resource identifiers may be passed either as an array of strings or as an ordinary string with one identifier per line of text. Please read the remarks section about restrictions.
- `filter`: `string` — A filter expression. Pass an empty string, if no filter ist required.
- `sortOrder`: `string` — A sort expression. Pass an empty string, if no sorting is required.
- `hitlist`: `HL` — The technical name of a hitlist or an array of field names, which specifies the available columns in the resultset. If the parameter is left empty, Documents tries to choose a hitlist automatically. Details follow in the remarks section.

Note: If this parameter is an array of field names, a search in EE.i or EE.x is not allowed and the field names must not contain commas (,).
- `pageSize`: `number` — This is a memory-saving and performance-tuning option. If the parameter is zero, Documents will load all available hits at once. If the parameter is a positive value, Documents will initially load only the requested number of hits as a first page. In order to access each further page, a call to fetchNextPage() is necessary. A negative pageSize value will be replaced by the current user's "hits per page" preference setting.

Default: 0.
- `unlimitedHits`: `boolean` — A boolean that indicates, if the general hit limitations on filetypes and archives must be ignored. A wasteful use of this option may cause issues with the system performance or situations with low free memory.

Default: false
- `fullColumnLength`: `boolean` — A boolean that indicates, if the general hit column length limitations must be ignored. The default column length is 50 characters (if not a different value is defined by the property Documents-Settings: MaxHitfieldLength). If a field value exceeds this size, the first 50 characters will be displayed followed by '...'. If the parameter fullColumnLength is set to true, no truncation will be done.

Default: false
- `withBlobInfo`: `boolean` — A boolean that indicates, if the HitResultset should contain blob-information that can be fetched with DocHit.getBlobInfo()

Default: false

**Returns:** HitResultset<K, HL>

**Since:** DOCUMENTS 4.0b
